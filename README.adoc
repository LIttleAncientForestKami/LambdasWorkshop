# LambdasWorkshop

During the workshops, we will focus on the advantages of lambdas. What do we need the for?
->Lambda expression is a function so we need them in functional programming.<-

Agenda.
 1. Why old-fashioned external iteration is error prone?
  a) Check and correct bugs,
  b) refactor to anonymous class,
  c) refactor to lambda expression.

 2. When lambda calls a method... Method references - less code, more readable code!

 3. Functional interfaces - link them all.

 4. Bonus! Can lambda expression be used to define recursive functions? Let's check it!

Enjoy!
