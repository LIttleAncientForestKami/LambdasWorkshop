= LambdasWorkshop

During the workshops, we will focus on the advantages of lambdas.What do we need them for?

Agenda.

1. Why old-fashioned external iteration is error prone?
a) Check and correct bugs,
b) replace loop with streams,
b) refactor to anonymous class,
c) refactor to lambda expression.

2. When lambda calls a method... Method references - less code, more readable code!

3. Compose functional interfaces - inspiration from one of the side quests;-) (Pawel K, who was not at the pre-academy - those were extra tasks.

4. Bonus!Can lambda expression be used to define recursive functions?Let's check it!

Enjoy!
